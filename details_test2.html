    <center><h3>CEREMONY / RECEPTION</h3></center>
    <h4>The Cadre Building - Saturday, September 16th 2017 - 7:30 PM</h4>
    <br>
    <h4>Attire: Black Tie Optional</h4>
    <br>
    <p>Located in the heart of downtown Memphis, the Cadre Building is a 36,000-square foot historic landmark. It was built in 1928 and was formally a Leader Federal Bank for Savings. Now, the space has been transformed into a grand ballroom. After seeing the Cadre, we instantly knew that we wanted to get married there. From the gorgeous crystal chandeliers and the detail-oriented columns that were hand-painted with gold leaf molding, we fell in love with the overall elegance of the building!</p>

    <center><h3>HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS</h3></center>
    <br>
    <p>For our out of town guests, we have a couple of hotel options. We will not be providing a shuttle service to and from the wedding because all of the hotels are within a short walking distance to the venue. Walking directions will be waiting for you at check-in. All of the hotel block rates start on Friday, September 15th with a Sunday, September 17th checkout. Choose what works best for you!</p>
    <h4>The Madison Hotel</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Address: 79 Madison Avenue, Memphis, TN 38103</h5>
    <h5>Room Block Rate: $159 a night plus tax</h5>
    <br>
    <p>We love The Madison Hotel and this would be our recommendation on where to stay. It’s a boutique luxury hotel that’s within walking distance to many attractions. The hotel is just steps away from the Main Street Trolley, which will give you full access to the places you’ll want to see, like Beale Street and the Mississippi Riverfront. The hotel’s contemporary style is super cool and it brings the musical spirit of Memphis to life. This is where we’re staying along with the bridal party!</p>
    <p>Call the hotel directly at 1-901-333-1200 to make your reservation. Reference the Buchwalter/Badrian wedding block to ensure that you get the contracted rate. We only did a limited amount of rooms here for the weekend because there’s an attrition clause. So if you call and more rooms need to be added we can absolutely do that for you. Just let us know! The rate is available until August 25th, 2017. If you rent a car, the overnight parking rate is $29 plus tax a night, but self-parking is available for much cheaper at other parking garages around the hotel. This hotel is the farthest walk to the venue, but it’s only a 6-minute walk.</p>
    <br>
        <h4>The Holiday Inn Downtown</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Address: 160 Union Avenue, Memphis, TN 38103</h5>
    <h5>Room Block Rate: $134 a night plus tax</h5>
    <br>
    <p>The Holiday Inn Downtown is also in a very convenient location. It’s directly across the street from the historic Peabody Hotel where you can see the duck march and just two blocks away from Beale Street. They also have a shuttle service that will take you anywhere within a 5 mile radius when available. The hotel is holding a rate quote for us instead of a block of rooms. If the hotel sells out of rooms for that weekend, the special rate price will no longer be available. So if you go with this hotel, book early and don’t wait until August 8th when the rate quote ends. Parking at the hotel is valet only for $22.00 plus tax a day. But again, you can park in a garage or lot close by for much cheaper. This hotel is the closest to the venue and is only a 2-minute walk.</p>
    <p>Call the hotel at 901-525-5491 to make a reservation. Say that you are calling for the Buchwalter-Badrian wedding.</p>
    <br>
            <h4>The DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Memphis Downtown</h4>
    <br>
    <h5>Address: 185 Union Avenue, Memphis, TN 38103</h5>
    <h5>Room Block Rate: $159 a night plus tax</h5>
    <br>
    <p>The DoubleTree is also walking distance to many places you’ll want to see like the Peabody ducks and the National Civil Rights Museum. It’s 3 blocks away from Beale Street and across the street from AutoZone Park. </p>
    <p>You can make your reservation by calling 1-800-222-8733 or 901-528-1800 and say the Buchwalter-Badrian wedding block. The cut-off date to make your reservation is August 18th, 2017. Guest valet parking is available for $25.00 plus tax a day or you can park at a parking garage close by. This hotel is a 3-minute walk to the venue.</p>
