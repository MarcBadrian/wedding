<em>Maid of Honor</em><br>
<br>
Though born in New Orleans, Sabrina has been marooned above the Mason Dixon line since graduating from LSU. She works for an NGO affiliated with the United Nations Department of Public Information and UNESCO (UN Economic and Social Council). In her spare time, she collects and sells china. She is the creator of the website – MoshiMotif.com – which references china patterns on TV shows and movies. Being Elizabeth’s older sister, Sabrina has known Liz for <em>almost</em> her entire life (Sabrina was sadly stuck at home with the babysitter when Elizabeth was born at the hospital).</p></li><li><img width="2000" height="1230" src="http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Venice-e1454277924935.jpeg?fit=2000%2C1230" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Jill and venetian windows" /><p>JILL TAYLOR
<br><br>
The shenanigans started for Liz and Jill circa 2003, back when they were still riding the bus to high school in Chalmette, Lousiana. Things only escalated from there. From nerding out in the Chemistry Club to feigning sophistication at an art gallery, they never had a dull moment while rooming together during two years of undergrad at LSU. Some of Jill's fondest memories with Liz are from their shared travels, including Chicago and Washington D.C., with Gatlinburg as her favorite escapade.</p></li><li><img width="715" height="436" src="http://i1.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10502183_10155653498245128_8921192808689650076_n-e1454277863302.jpg?fit=715%2C436" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="10502183_10155653498245128_8921192808689650076_n" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10502183_10155653498245128_8921192808689650076_n-e1454277863302.jpg?resize=300%2C183 300w, http://i1.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10502183_10155653498245128_8921192808689650076_n-e1454277863302.jpg?w=715 715w" sizes="(max-width: 715px) 100vw, 715px" /><p>CAITLIN WATKINS
<br><br>
Caitlin is eighteen years old and finishing up her senior year of high school.  She lives in Merrimack, New Hampshire with her family.  She will be majoring in elementary education in college next year.  Caitlin is Liz's goddaughter and has forever been a big part of her life.  They both enjoy creative art and have recently painted pottery together. Caitlin and Liz also share a love for Sephora face masks. Caitlin cannot wait to be a part of Liz and Nick's wedding!</p></li><li><img width="1308" height="800" src="http://i1.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/melissa.jpg?fit=1308%2C800" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="melissa" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/melissa.jpg?resize=300%2C183 300w, http://i1.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/melissa.jpg?resize=768%2C470 768w, http://i1.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/melissa.jpg?resize=1024%2C626 1024w, http://i1.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/melissa.jpg?w=1308 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 1308px) 100vw, 1308px" /><p>MELISSA CALLOWAY
<br><br>
From DeRidder, Louisiana, Melissa now lives in Austin, Texas and is a writer and also a counselor at the Art Institute.  Melissa is a new aunt and loves spending time with her family and her dog named Bear.  Liz met Melissa through mutual friends at Louisiana State University and quickly became friends and became roommates as well. Melissa and Liz share odd senses of humor and a love for wine and people watching.  Melissa looks forward to visiting Liz in Philly again soon!</p></li><li><img width="1674" height="1024" src="http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10974365_792656638059_2509901684869091133_o-e1454278337731.jpg?fit=1674%2C1024" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="10974365_792656638059_2509901684869091133_o" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10974365_792656638059_2509901684869091133_o-e1454278337731.jpg?resize=300%2C184 300w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10974365_792656638059_2509901684869091133_o-e1454278337731.jpg?resize=768%2C470 768w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10974365_792656638059_2509901684869091133_o-e1454278337731.jpg?resize=1024%2C626 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/10974365_792656638059_2509901684869091133_o-e1454278337731.jpg?w=1674 1674w" sizes="(max-width: 1674px) 100vw, 1674px" /><p>KASEY DISERENS
<br><br>
Originally from New York, Kasey and Liz met when they both moved to Philadelphia for graduate school in Historic Preservation. They were friends from the very beginning, Kasey happily pairing up with Liz as her lab partner for a chemistry based materials science class (Kasey learned so much about chemicals from Liz).  After graduation, Liz stayed on in Philly to work, Kasey stayed on for...more school.  Currently in a PhD program, when time allows Kasey enjoys meeting up with Liz (and Nick) to test out new beers and restaurants in Philly.  Liz and Kasey have also taken some exciting trips together!</p></li><li><img width="2920" height="1786" src="http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sarah2.jpg?fit=2920%2C1786" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Sarah2" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sarah2.jpg?resize=300%2C183 300w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sarah2.jpg?resize=768%2C470 768w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sarah2.jpg?resize=1024%2C626 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sarah2.jpg?w=2920 2920w" sizes="(max-width: 2920px) 100vw, 2920px" /><p>SARAH VANLANDINGHAM
<br><br>
Sarah is originally from State College, Pennsylvania. She met Liz in graduate school at Penn where they took breaks from learning about preserving old buildings to sample Philadelphia's best happy hours. They became close friends and have taken plenty of opportunities since graduating for "girls weekends" to get together and stay updated on each other's lives. Sarah works for the District government in Washington, DC as a Historic Preservation Specialist. She looks forward to many visits to Philadelphia in preparation for the upcoming wedding!</p></li></ul>

<em>Best Man</em><br>
<br>
While Comcast’s acquisition of NBCUniversal has had many impacts, few can argue that one of the biggest was Nick meeting Justin in January of 2011.  Needing more corporate staff to take on one of the world’s largest media businesses, Justin and Nick both landed at Comcast and sat next to each other in new hire orientation.  They quickly formed a bond over growing up in Northwest Philadelphia, being Catholic, and the most efficient way to expand SEPTA’s route network (in that order).</p></li><li><img width="960" height="638" src="http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Steve-Miller-e1456195371321.jpg?fit=960%2C638" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Steve-Miller" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Steve-Miller-e1456195371321.jpg?resize=300%2C199 300w, http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Steve-Miller-e1456195371321.jpg?resize=768%2C510 768w, http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Steve-Miller-e1456195371321.jpg?w=960 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p>STEVE MILLER<br>
<br>
Steve and Nick both attended La Salle College High School and worked in the Lab Manager program together, eventually becoming co-leads.  In addition to learning about Windows Domain infrastructure, the Linux command line, and web development, they became close friends.  Their friendship ensured and strengthened after Steve went to Drexel and Nick went to Penn State in large part to the Summer Street house.  Over the years they have shared many interests including music, craft beer, and the fading relevance of processor technology circa 2003.</p></li><li><img width="2028" height="1350" src="http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joe-Micucci-e1456873836642.jpg?fit=2028%2C1350" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Joe-Micucci" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joe-Micucci-e1456873836642.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joe-Micucci-e1456873836642.jpg?resize=768%2C511 768w, http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joe-Micucci-e1456873836642.jpg?resize=1024%2C682 1024w, http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Joe-Micucci-e1456873836642.jpg?w=2028 2028w" sizes="(max-width: 2028px) 100vw, 2028px" /><p>JOE MICUCCI<br>
<br>
It is most likely that Nick truly met Joe during their junior year at La Salle College High School through their dominance of other Lasallians in the school’s Age of Empires II circuit.  After eventually meeting each other in-person and having a number of classes together, Nick and Joe lived with each other for their first two years at Penn State.  Nick taught Joe all about school spirit, although this proved to be a double-edged sword as Joe is now hopelessly addicted to college sports.</p></li><li><img width="880" height="585" src="http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dave-Prisco-e1456193749609.jpg?fit=880%2C585" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Dave-Prisco" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dave-Prisco-e1456193749609.jpg?resize=300%2C199 300w, http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dave-Prisco-e1456193749609.jpg?resize=768%2C511 768w, http://i2.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Dave-Prisco-e1456193749609.jpg?w=880 880w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /><p>DAVE PRISCO<br>
<br>
While it’s open to interpretation if Nick actually knew Dave at La Salle College High School prior to Dave’s limited-invite graduation party, they have been great friends ever since Nick and Steve Miller happened to run into Dave after work one day at Sláinte.  Their love of baseball and banter is only rivaled by that of the obscure.  After surviving the highs and lows of the infamous summer of 2010 as well as their 2011-2012 Philadelphia Flyers partial season ticket plan, it’s clear that Dave’s friendship is matched only by his reliability.</p></li><li><img width="1200" height="800" src="http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ben-Spanswick-e1456196146337.jpg?fit=1200%2C800" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Ben-Spanswick" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ben-Spanswick-e1456196146337.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ben-Spanswick-e1456196146337.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ben-Spanswick-e1456196146337.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Ben-Spanswick-e1456196146337.jpg?w=1200 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p>BEN SPANSWICK<br>
<br>
Nick has mentored Ben in numerous ways throughout the years, mainly as an older brother in Sigma Nu and academically in Penn State’s Security and Risk Analysis program. It’s hard to describe what Ben’s most defining trait is.  Would it be his English wit?  Or is it his French sophistication?  Perhaps it’s his Pennsylvanian pragmatism.  But then there is his inexplicable affinity for fantasy NASCAR (really). Ben is as enigmatic as his habitations have been numerous.</p></li><li><img width="960" height="638" src="http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gabe-Adorno-e1456194452690.jpg?fit=960%2C638" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Gabe-Adorno" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gabe-Adorno-e1456194452690.jpg?resize=300%2C199 300w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gabe-Adorno-e1456194452690.jpg?resize=768%2C510 768w, http://i0.wp.com/futuremrandmrs.covolus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Gabe-Adorno-e1456194452690.jpg?w=960 960w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><p>GABE ADORNO<br>

Nick met Gabe through Sigma Nu at Penn State.  As one of their fraternity brothers puts it, “I’ve never quite met someone like Gabe,” which rings as true as can be.  When he’s not gallivanting through Europe or Southeast Asia, he can be found either in the cab of a Wister Oil truck or running roughshod over the other Quizzo players at Franklin’s.  As an interesting aside and proving how small the world can be, Gabe went to high school with bridesmaid Kasey Diserens in Bronxville, NY.</p></li></ul>
